# 🎮 Deep Reinforcement Learning – Atari Pong Agent  
**Drexel University – Applied Machine Learning Engineering (Summer 2025)**  
**Author:** Akash Adrashannavar  

This project implements a **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** agent that learns to play Atari **Pong** using **Policy Gradient methods (REINFORCE)** in TensorFlow/Keras.  
Two agents were trained:  
- **Pong–Easy**  
- **Pong–Hard**

The agent improves entirely through experience, learning to maximize long-term reward.
